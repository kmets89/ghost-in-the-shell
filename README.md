# ghost-in-the-shell
A super cool shell

In this shell, special characters are enabled and echo is disabled.  The shell can execute commands normally.  It also accepts a pipe command: exec1 | exec2, where the output of exec1 is the input of exec2.  It also has a merge command: src1.txt src2.txt > dest.txt.  It stores the last 10 commands in history, which can be cycled through using the arrow up and down keys.
